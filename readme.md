# WLED-RPM-Meter
A WLED usermod used to display RPM to LED strip.

## How It Works
This usermod uses ELM327 bluetooth OBD-II adapter to read RPM value from vehicle's ECU and display it to LED strip as percentage value. The LED strip must be set to "Percent" effect mode in order to function correctly.
